Another late-binding scheme that is already necessary is to get away from direct protocol matching when a new object shows up in a system of objects. In other words, if someone sends you an object from halfway around the world it will be unusual if it conforms to your local protocols. At some point it will be easier to have it carry even more information about itselfâ€”enough so its specifications can be "understood" and its configuration into your mix done by the more subtle matching of inference.
