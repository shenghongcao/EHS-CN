> Several instances of the class box are created and sent messages, culminating with a simple multiprocess animation.

 "class box"不知道该怎么翻译，结合图示，感觉这里是指程序操控的“方框”，就像 turtle一样。 

 > "class"是类的意思，"class box"可以理解成”模版”。“instance”是”实例”的意思。就像模具出来的零件。

“this idea”字典翻译多为“想法”、“主意”；但是感觉中文里“想法”“主意”都侧重没有进入实施的设想。而这里经过实践，发现非常的美妙，似乎用“方法”更好一些。
