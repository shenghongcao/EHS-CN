## Metalinguistic Abstraction

When developing software systems, [creating new languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalinguistic_abstraction) is sometimes the best approach for dealing with complexity. It allows the programmer to focus on the problem instead of being distracted by implementation details.

META II is itself a language specific to the domain of compiler writing.

> "META II is a compiler writing language which consists of syntax equations resembling Backus normal form and into which instructions to output assembly language commands are inserted."
