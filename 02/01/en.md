New ideas go through stages of acceptance, both from within and without. 
From within, 
the sequence moves from "barely seeing" a pattern several times, 
then noting it but not perceiving its "cosmic" significance, 
then using it operationally in several areas, 
then comes a "grand rotation" in which the pattern becomes the center of a new way of thinking, 
and finally, 
it turns into the same kind of inflexible religion that it originally broke away from. 
From without, 
as Schopenhauer noted, 
the new idea is first denounced as the work of the insane, 
in a few years it is considered obvious and mundane, 
and finally the original denouncers will claim to have invented it.
