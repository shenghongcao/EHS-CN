Programming languages can be categorized in a number of ways: imperative, applicative, logic-based, problem-oriented, etc. 
But they all seem to be either an "agglutination of features" or a "crystallization of style." 
COBOL, PL/1, Ada, etc., belong to the first kind; LISP, APL— and Smalltalk—are the second kind. 
It is probably not an accident that the agglutinative languages all seem to have been instigated by committees, and the crystallization languages by a single person.
