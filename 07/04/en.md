From the late-binding perspective, OOP can be viewed as a comprehensive technique for late-binding as many things as possible: the mix of state and process in a set of behaviors, where they are located, what they are called, when and why the are invoked, which HW is used, etc., and more subtle, the strategies used in the OOP scheme itself. The art of the wrap is the art of the trap.
